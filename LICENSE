   Z3ST: An open-source FEniCSx framework for thermo-mechanical analysis
   ---------------------------------------------------------
   Z3ST is an open-source finite element framework for coupled
   thermo-mechanical analysis of multi-material domains.

   Developed by:

   Description:
       Z3ST couples heat conduction and linear elasticity in transient
       or stationary conditions, using modular YAML-driven configuration
       and Python-based post-processing tools.
